SPECS

If a user enters something that is not a number into the input box, an error prompt will appear.
  Input: "Hello World!"
  Output: Alert: "Please enter a number!"

If a user does not answer the 3 LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATOR questions and insert a valid number into the input box, 
  an error alert will appear.
  Input: "42" (No questions answered).
  Output: Alert: "Please answer all the questions!"


When user inputs an numerical value for their age (in Earth years), the program should return the equivalent
  to that age in X planet years for 5 planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter).
  Ex:
  1 year Mercury = 0.24 years Earth
  1 year Venus = 0.62 years Earth
  1 year Mars = 1.88 years Earth
  1 year Jupiter = 11.86 years Earth

  Input: 2
  Output: Mercury = 0.48, Venus = 1.24, Mars = 3.76, Jupiter = 23.72

When user inputs their age (in Earth years), the program will return the numbers of years the user
  has left on X planet. The return number will be presented in that planets years. Life Expectancy will be calculated by (LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATOR).

LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATOR
    When user answers three questions, the program will take the input and calculate their life expectancy for X planet (in that planet's years, rounded to the nearest tenth).
      Questions include:
      1. Do you eat ice cream? (Y/N)
      2. Do you exercise? (Y/N)
      3. Do you use hard drugs? We promise we're cool, you can tell us. (Y/N)

      Logic to determine expectancy includes:
      60 years life expectancy = (Hard Drugs === Y)
      70 years life expectancy = (Exercise === Y || Ice Cream === Y || Hard Drugs === N)
      80 years life expectancy = (Exercise === Y || Ice Cream === N || Hard Drugs === N)

      Input: Hard Drugs/Yes, 40 years
      Output: 83.3 years left on Mercury
      Input: Exercise/Yes, Ice Cream/Y, Hard Drugs/N, 40 years 
      Output: 32.3 years left on Venus
      Input: Exercise/Yes, Ice Cream/N. Hard Drugs/N, 40 years
      Output: 10.6 years left on Mars
      Input: Hard Drugs/Yes, 40 years
      Output: 1.7 years left on Jupiter
