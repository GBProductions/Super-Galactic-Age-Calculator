SPECS

When user inputs an numerical value for their age (in Earth years), the program should return the equivalent
  to that age in X planet years for 5 planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter).
  Ex:
  1 year Mercury = 0.24 years Earth
  1 year Venus = 0.62 years Earth
  1 year Mars = 1.88 years Earth
  1 year Jupiter = 11.86 years Earth

  Input: 2
  Output: Mercury = 0.48, Venus = 1.24, Mars = 3.76, Jupiter = 23.72

When user inputs their age (in Earth years), the program will return the numbers of years the user
  has left on X planet. The return number will be presented in that planets years. Life Expectancy will be calculated by (LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATOR).

LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATOR
When user answers three questions, the program will take the input and calculate their life expectancy for X planet (in Earth years).
  Questions include:
  1. Do you eat ice cream? (Y/N)
  2. Do you exercise? (Y/N)
  3. Do you use hard drugs? We promise we're cool, you can tell us. (Y/N)

  60 years life expectancy = (Hard Drugs === Y)
  70 years life expectancy = (Exercise === Y || Ice Cream === Y || Hard Drugs === N)
  80 years life expectancy = (Exercise === Y || Ice Cream === N || Hard Drugs === N)
